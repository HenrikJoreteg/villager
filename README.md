villager.io (work in progress)
==============================
__Forget massive corporate social networks. Let's build villages.__

First implementation will be [triciti.es](http://triciti.es), successor to [WeCreate TC](http://wecreate.tc).

The project takes its name from [Jane Jacobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs) (above) and her work on the [urban village](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_village). The underlying thesis of this project is that our online connectedness can be a tool to help overcome the tragic disconnectedness of suburbia.

## Setup

Want to contribute? Here's what you need to do to run this app locally.

1. Go [configure a Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new)

  - Make sure to check *Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter*
  - It doesn't matter what you put in the callback URL.
  
2. Copy ``sample_config.json`` to ``dev_config.json`` and edit accordingly:

  - Grab the *Consumer Key (API Key)* and set it as ``ClientId``
  - Grab the *Consumer Secret (API Secret)* and set it as ``ClientSecret``

3. ``npm i`` to install dependencies.

4. ``npm start`` to run.

__Important note:__ I just realized this app *temporarily* requires a nlfpm account in order to compile CSS. This app uses [yeti.css](http://yeticss.com) by [Karolina](https://github.com/thefoxis), which is not published publically yet.
