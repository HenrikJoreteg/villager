villager.io (work in progress)
==============================
__Forget massive corporate social networks. Let's build villages.__

First implementation: [triciti.es](http://triciti.es)

The project takes its name from [Jane Jacobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs) and her work on the [urban village](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_village). It is the underlying thesis of this project that our online connectedness can be a tool to help overcome the tragic disconnectedness of suburbia.

> __“Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.”__
