triciti.es
==========
Wouldn't it be great if there was a good site to create and share the indie culture and community of the Tri-Cities?

People, places, groups, events, music, and more.

This is the spiritual successor to [wecreate.tc](http://wecreate.tc), but it'll be a lot more than that.

## TODO

- Add places, groups, events, projects
- Moderation of submitted entries
- <3s for favorite locations
- Add list of interests
- Ability to be a member of a group
- Events, calendar, RSVPs
