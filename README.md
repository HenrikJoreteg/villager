triciti.es
==========
Wouldn't it be great if there was a good site to create and share the indie culture and community of the Tri-Cities?

People, places, groups, events, projects.

This is the spiritual successor to [wecreate.tc](http://wecreate.tc), but it'll be more than that.

## Done:

- Add yourself by logging in with Twitter
- List people, places, groups
- Add and pre-approve users by Twitter handle
- Add moderators
- List pending submissions
- Moderate submitted entries
- Probably some other stuff

## Todo:

- Add events, projects
- <3s for favorite locations
- Add list of interests
- Ability to be a member of a group
- Events, calendar, RSVPs
- Relationships
